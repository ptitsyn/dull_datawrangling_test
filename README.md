Collect data from a few tables and put it in a weird, inconvenient format for a challenge

I hate coding tests. Who doesn't? First, this is an insult. The default assumption behind any such test is that the candidate who applied for a job is a liar who has no required qualifications and has to prove the opposite. The company that orders such test after the technical interview has already proved incompetent: the hiring manager and other interviewers could not figure out the candidates' qualification by asking questions. If so, how does doing some dull unpaid work help?
Nevertheless, tests are incredibly common. As common as incompetent interviewers. Typically, I reject the proposition to do the test or make a counter-offer to do it for a payment based on prevailing consulting rate. Once in a while, I take a test for fun or for a workout if I have nothing better to occupy myself.
